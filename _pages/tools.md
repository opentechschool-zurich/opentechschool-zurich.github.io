# Learning some Tools

## The Command Line

- [Master the command line, in one page](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line).

## Editors

- [A Vim Guide For Experts](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-expert/)

## We're open for suggestions

We are looking for good tutorials for learning:

- SSH
- Git
- Docker
- Databases

We prefer free tutorials (Creative commons, GPL, ...), or at least for free, but we also list _commercial_ resources when they are worth the money.
