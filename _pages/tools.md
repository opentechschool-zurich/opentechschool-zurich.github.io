# Learning some Tools

## The Command Line

- [Master the command line, in one page](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line).

## We're open for suggestions

We are looking for good tutorials for learning:

- SSH
- Git
- Docker
- Databases

We prefer free tutorials (Creative commons, GPL, ...), or at least for free, but we also list _commercial_ resources when they are worth the money.

# Tools for online Co-Learnings

Chatting:

- Element for the text chat
- Jitsi for the video chat

Collaborative editing (and running):

- [CodeCollab](https://codecollab.io) (Almost everything but frontend JS)
- [paiza.io](https://paiza.io/)
- [SyncFiddle](https://syncfiddle.net) (frontend javascript only)
- [repl.it](https://repl.it) (all collaborators need to have an account)

Editing and running (not collaborative):

- [codepad](http://codepad.org/)
