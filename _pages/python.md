# Learning Python

## Python

If you want to learn programming, python is a good language to start with.

The OpenTechSchool has a [list of Python workshops](http://python.opentechschool.org/). If you want us organize one, [just ask for it](contact)!

There are several online resources we are currently recommending:

{: .books}

  [Solo Learn](https://www.sololearn.com/course/python/)  
  You will not get very far, but you will be hold by hand...
- ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/languages/ethz-python.png){: .book-cover}  
  [Programming Basics Python](https://www.et.ethz.ch/)  
  Online tutorial by the ETHZ

## Online courses

- [futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io/course/)
- [Python programming tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/python-fundamental-tutorials/) by Harrison Kinsley

## Intermediate and advanced

- [Intermediate Python](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)

## Python and PyGame

You can directly dive into [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news), or first learn the educational frameworks [PyGame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Pygame Play](https://github.com/replit/play).

- [PyGame Zero Cards](https://github.com/CoderDojoZH/resources/tree/master/cards-python/mu-pgzero) by CoderDojo Zürich.

## Python, Jupyter and data science

- [Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
- [Kagle's  micro course for Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) and the [follow-ups for data sciense](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/)

A good introductory exercise:

- Requirements: Know about lists, for loops and objects.
- Install Jupyter.
- Create an Excel file with four columns: Name, Address, Post Code, Place.
- Use Pandas to read the Excel file.
- Take the Address, Post Code and Place columns and create a list of strings ("Address, Post Code Place").
- Use Geopy to convert the address into latitudes and longitudes.
- Use iPyLeaflet for displaying the coordinates on a map.

## Pycharm

- [Meet PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/meet-pycharm.html)

## Python and Qt

- [PyQt5 tutorial: Learn how you can create a Python GUI in 2019.](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial)

## Virtual Environments

- [Python Project Setup – Virtual Environments and Package Management](https://bas.codes/posts/python-virtualenv-venv-pip-pyenv-poetry)

## We're open for suggestions

We are looking for good tutorials for learning:

- Python and Flask
- Python and PySide / PyQt
- Python and Shoebot
- Python and Scribus / Inkscape
