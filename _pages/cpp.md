## C++ 

{: .books}
- ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/languages/sololearn-cpp.png){: .book-cover .circle}  
  [sololearn: c++](https://www.sololearn.com/course/cplusplus/): you will not get very far, but it's a very gentle introductionâ€¦
- ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/languages/cpp-principles-practice.jpg){: .book-cover}  
  [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++](www.stroustrup.com/books.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup.  
  Not the easiest book to read but Bjarne is the creator of C++ and you will learn lot of things.

## We're open for suggestions

We are looking for good tutorials for learning:

- C++ and Qt
- C++ and cmake
- C

We prefer free tutorials (Creative commons, GPL, ...), or at least for free, but we also list _commercial_ resources when they are worth the money.
