# Learning programming

Most people when they first start learning programming they have lot of questions:

- Which language should I learn?
- Should I buy a book?
- Should I enroll in an online course?
- 

There is no single answer to all those question. It's even likely that there is no clear cut answer to any of those question, even for a specific person.

But there are a few hints that can help

- For many people, learning by doing is the best approach: try to find a book or tutorial that gets you to build small programs.
- Try to find a good mix of learning, doing exercises and working on a small project.


## Your own pet project

- [What do you want to learn today ?](https://aquadzn.github.io/learn-x-by-doing-y/): many ideas for the project based learning.

## C++

  [sololearn: c++](https://www.sololearn.com/course/cplusplus/): you will not get very far, but it's a very gentle introductionâ€¦

  [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++](www.stroustrup.com/books.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup.  
  Not the easiest book to read but Bjarne is the creator of C++ and you will learn lot of things.

## We're open for suggestions

We are looking for good tutorials for learning:

- C++ and Qt
- C++ and cmake
- C

We prefer free tutorials (Creative commons, GPL, ...), or at least for free, but we also list _commercial_ resources when they are worth the money.
