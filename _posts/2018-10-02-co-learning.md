A couple of new lerners for both Python and C++, a group working on learning PySide2 and one fighting with Qt...

Richard: Work on QT GUI for MongoDB. Struggling with segfaults, null pointers & syntax highlighting in QtCreator.

ale: got [qt for python]() (PySide2) to work in a virtual environment and followed the examples in [this tutorial](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial): It simple works and the code is tiny and very readable!  
The next time, I'll try to read a `.ui` file (from Qt Designer) and create a package that can be distributed!

Charles: Joined Ale with Qt for Python, and had a lot of fun learning something new.
